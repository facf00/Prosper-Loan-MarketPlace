## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that Borrower APR  was a negatively correlated with the original loan amount.The Borrower APR also decreases with better prosper ratings.
The main categories are Debt Consolidations, Auto and Others.
The most choose term to pay is 36 months.Better income ranges, and being a home owner gets you better rates.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the most predicable variations  leave out most of the intermediate derivations. I start by introducing the
borrower APR distribution, followed by monthly loans payments and income ranges, then plot the
transformed scatterplot with the stated monthly income and the monthly payments, borrower APR across Prosper rating.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. To start,
I use the box plots and violin plots of prosper rating and owning a home across borrower APR.
